Sales Data Analysis for a Commercial Store
This repository contains an analysis of sales data for a commercial store. The dataset includes sales transactions over several months, and we will analyze the following:

Total Sales Revenue
Sales by Region
Sales by Product Category
Payment Method Distribution
Trends over Time (Seasonality)
Insights and Recommendations
Files
sales_data.csv: A CSV file containing the raw sales data.
sales_analysis.ipynb: A Jupyter Notebook for performing the analysis using Python and pandas.
README.md: This file contains an overview of the project and analysis results.
Step 1: Sample Sales Data
You can upload the data as a CSV file (sales_data.csv), which includes fields like Date, Region, Product Category, Units Sold, Unit Price, Revenue, and Payment Type.

Here's an example of what the sales_data.csv could look like:

csv
Date,Region,Product Category,Units Sold,Unit Price,Revenue,Payment Type
2024-01-01,North,Electronics,10,100,1000,Credit Card
2024-01-01,South,Clothing,15,50,750,Cash
2024-01-02,East,Electronics,5,120,600,Debit Card
2024-01-02,West,Home Goods,8,80,640,Credit Card
2024-01-03,North,Clothing,20,45,900,Debit Card
2024-01-03,South,Home Goods,12,75,900,Cash
Step 2: Create Jupyter Notebook (sales_analysis.ipynb)
Inside the Jupyter Notebook (sales_analysis.ipynb), we will perform several steps to clean and analyze the sales data.

python
# Importing libraries
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

# Load data
data = pd.read_csv('sales_data.csv')

# Display first few rows of the data
data.head()

# Total Sales Revenue
total_revenue = data['Revenue'].sum()
print(f'Total Sales Revenue: ${total_revenue:,.2f}')

# Sales by Region
sales_by_region = data.groupby('Region')['Revenue'].sum().sort_values(ascending=False)
print("\nSales by Region:")
print(sales_by_region)

# Sales by Product Category
sales_by_category = data.groupby('Product Category')['Revenue'].sum().sort_values(ascending=False)
print("\nSales by Product Category:")
print(sales_by_category)

# Payment Type Distribution
payment_type_distribution = data['Payment Type'].value_counts()
print("\nPayment Type Distribution:")
print(payment_type_distribution)

# Trend of Sales over Time (Seasonality)
data['Date'] = pd.to_datetime(data['Date'])
data['Month'] = data['Date'].dt.to_period('M')
monthly_sales = data.groupby('Month')['Revenue'].sum()

print("\nMonthly Sales Trend:")
print(monthly_sales)

# Visualizations
# Plotting sales by region
plt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))
sns.barplot(x=sales_by_region.index, y=sales_by_region.values, palette='Blues_d')
plt.title('Sales by Region')
plt.ylabel('Revenue ($)')
plt.xticks(rotation=45)
plt.show()

# Plotting sales by product category
plt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))
sns.barplot(x=sales_by_category.index, y=sales_by_category.values, palette='viridis')
plt.title('Sales by Product Category')
plt.ylabel('Revenue ($)')
plt.xticks(rotation=45)
plt.show()

# Payment Type Distribution Pie Chart
plt.figure(figsize=(6, 6))
payment_type_distribution.plot(kind='pie', autopct='%1.1f%%', startangle=90, colors=['#f39c12', '#e74c3c', '#2ecc71'])
plt.title('Payment Type Distribution')
plt.ylabel('')
plt.show()

# Monthly Sales Trend
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
monthly_sales.plot(kind='line', marker='o', color='tab:blue')
plt.title('Monthly Sales Trend')
plt.ylabel('Revenue ($)')
plt.xticks(rotation=45)
plt.grid(True)
plt.show()

Step 3: Visualize the Data
Here are a few charts that you’ll generate in the notebook based on the analysis:

Sales by Region (Bar Chart): This chart shows the total sales revenue by region. The regions with the highest sales will be easily identifiable.

Sales by Product Category (Bar Chart): This bar chart displays the total revenue generated by each product category.

Payment Type Distribution (Pie Chart): This pie chart shows the distribution of payment methods used by customers (Credit Card, Cash, Debit Card).

Monthly Sales Trend (Line Chart): This line chart shows how sales revenue changes over time. It can help identify seasonality or specific months with spikes or dips.

Step 4: Insights and Recommendations
At the end of the analysis, you can provide some insights and recommendations based on the data:

Key Insights:
Highest Revenue Region: The region with the highest revenue could suggest where most of your customers are concentrated.
Top Performing Product Category: The category with the most revenue can indicate which product types are the most popular or which areas to focus on for marketing.
Payment Preferences: Most customers use credit cards, so offering additional promotions or discounts tied to this payment method could boost sales.
Seasonality Trends: If sales peak during certain months, you could plan promotions or inventory adjustments around those months.
Recommendations:
Focus on High-Performing Regions: Increase marketing efforts in regions that generate higher revenue.
Optimize Stock in Popular Categories: Ensure that best-selling product categories are always well-stocked.
Payment Incentives: Offer discounts or loyalty programs for customers who pay using a particular method (e.g., Credit Card).
Prepare for Seasonal Changes: Increase stock and run targeted campaigns before peak sales months.
Step 5: GitHub Repository Structure
Here's a potential folder structure for your GitHub repository:

bash
